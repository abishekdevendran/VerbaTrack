# VerbaTrack

VerbaTrack revolutionizes habit tracking with user-friendly, structured 'commitment sentences.' Users set personal goals using plain language, specifying actions, timeframes, and desired progress. The app's intuitive design empowers users to effortlessly commit to and track their habits. By translating intentions into clear, human-readable sentences, VerbaTrack provides a unique and engaging way to build positive habits and achieve personal growth.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main components: the client and the server.

### Client

The `client` folder contains the front-end portion of the application, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The Next.js App Router is used to create dynamic routes and provide a smooth navigation experience. The client is designed with user-friendly interfaces and interactive features to enhance habit tracking and commitment.

### Server

The `server` folder houses the back-end part of the application, responsible for handling data and user interactions. The back-end is built with [LuciaAuth](https://luciaauth.com/) for authentication, ensuring secure user access. The use of [Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for package management optimizes dependency resolution and project maintenance. The project is structured as a monorepo, allowing for efficient code organization and management.

## Personal Goals

As part of the development process, the following personal goals were targeted:

- **Learning LuciaAuth:** A focus on mastering LuciaAuth for secure and efficient user authentication.
- **Next.js App Router:** Exploring and implementing the Next.js App Router for dynamic and intuitive routing.
- **Pnpm Usage:** Leveraging the benefits of Pnpm for streamlined package management.
- **Monorepo Implementation:** Developing a monorepo structure to enhance codebase organization and scalability.
- **Using Dribble** Making do with Dribble for design inspiration and ideas.
